I have one candidate that fits in the compensation range that we are looking at (they are looking for $130k+) total package, but I truly believe we would have more qualified and impressive talent if we can adjust the compensation range to be more competitive in the geography. We spoke to five potential candidate in the area last week and all five were $115k+. Still only 24 applicants since 5/23.(7/21) Compensation becoming a major issue, spoke with five potential P2 candidates this week and all were 115k+ in base salary, still only 24 applicants through taleo (7/14) HM has released Nikki from process, Matt was no show for his interview (6/29) Interviews with Matt and Nikki this week(6/23) Submitted Nikki Kavanaugh (6/16) Sourcing candidates salaries ranging from 100-120k and OTE of 200k + (6/8) Submitted Matt Weinstock HM interviewed Nathan on 6/7 need feedback (6/1) Submitted one candidate (5/26)The sales rep position in San Francisco has still been slow going. We determined that there was an issue with the posting, thus keeping us from identifying a lot of resumes from candidates who would have applied for the job. Since we posted the role we have only had three more applicants, and identifying interested passive candidates has been tough.  (5/16) Position has been open since 4/21 at this point only 5 candidates have applied through Taleo. Of which zero appear to be qualified outside of one with a internship at a respiratory organization in college.","",""
